Eco-Cart+ 🌿

A Sustainable E-Commerce Java Swing Ecosystem

📌 Overview
Eco-Cart+ is a role-based, interactive desktop application built in Java Swing, designed to promote sustainable commerce through a collaborative ecosystem of buyers, sellers, auditors, and logistics personnel. It simulates a multi-enterprise e-commerce environment that incorporates eco-score auditing, carbon tracking, financial transparency, and customer support modules, all designed with real-world workflows in mind.

This project was designed, implemented, and documented entirely by me, meeting enterprise-scale complexity while showcasing robust software engineering and UI/UX capabilities.
